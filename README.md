# YumMatch
* Prepocessed a dataset that had client_id, order_id, item_name, quantity, price & date with 687911 entries.
* Depending on the order_id and the date, we found out that what are the meals that are eaten together.
* Depending on the above data, we found the data for the most popular meal combos.
* With the help of Association Rules using Apriori, we found out that what meals will the customers like to have together.
* We then deployed the app with the help of streamlit using localtunnel (Used colab because too many iterations were incompatible with the local GPU)
